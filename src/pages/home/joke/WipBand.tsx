/* The backstage band — what the companion is doing while you wait.
 *
 * It mounts the instant "write my set" is pressed and fills the gap that used
 * to be silent: the spill goes off to be scrubbed, read for crisis and stored,
 * and only then are three cards written. That is a long time to show nothing.
 *
 * Two rules make it a band rather than a spinner:
 *
 *   · every number on it is true. The stage label, the meter and the ✓ on a
 *     mini card are read off the cards that have actually landed — which is
 *     why the deal is written one slot at a time (see writeJokeCard). If the
 *     writer is slow, the band says so; it never fakes a march to 100%.
 *   · it narrates, it does not apologise. The copy escalates with the wait —
 *     past 22s it admits it is taking a while, past 42s it admits that is
 *     embarrassing — because a wait someone is being talked through is a
 *     different wait from a wait they are being ignored during.
 *
 * The deck below stays tappable throughout: a back can be turned over before
 * its card is written and it waits on its edge (see useDeck). This band is the
 * readout, never the gate. */
