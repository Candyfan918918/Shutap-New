/* Your cards, newest first.
 *
 * A kept card is shown AS A CARD — the same 9:16 artifact the deck deals and
 * the export saves, so what you scroll past here is what you would send
 * someone. It used to be a text row, which made a kept card read like a
 * quotation of itself rather than the thing you kept.
 *
 * The situation heads the group once and is left off the cards under it: all
 * three were written for the same line, and printing it on each is the same
 * sentence three times. That is the one way these differ from a card in the
 * deck, where nothing sits above it to carry the context.
 *
 * Unflipped positions are not shown, at any tier. A card that was never
 * flipped was never written and does not exist: no ghost rows, no blurred
 * teasers, no "2 more". The free tier renders completely at its own depth.
 *
 * Shared by the joke surface and the profile's cards tab, so the two cannot
 * drift into two different ideas of what a kept card looks like. */
