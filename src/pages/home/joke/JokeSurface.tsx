/* The joke-card surface.
 *
 * The flow, in the order a person meets it:
 *   spill → the companion OFFERS three cards → three cards → read them
 *   → save / share → (guest) the alias gate → (free) the clean-cards upsell
 *   → (member) clean exports and the offer to post it in a room.
 *
 * Three rules hold the shape, and every branch below obeys them:
 *   · reading is free at every tier, guests included. Nothing gates a card.
 *   · the companion offers the cards at a positive peak. There is no
 *     standalone share button anywhere on this surface.
 *   · crisis outranks all of it: no cards, no gate, no paywall.
 *
 * The tier, the card text and the export size are all resolved on the server.
 * This component only draws what it is handed. */
